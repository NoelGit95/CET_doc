CET Data (csv file)
*******************

The cet_data.csv file provides the playerâ€™s Carbon, Car Miles and
Bonus values. There are 20 unique combinations of carbon, car miles
and bonus values in the file. Those rows are repeated once, yielding a
total of 40 data rows. Each data row supplies data for a CET round,
hence the number of data rows is equal to the number of rounds in the
CET (40).

Experimenters can extend the csv file with more data rows, which in
turn increases the number of rounds in the CET. Furthermore, the data
values can be modified, if experimenters want to explore different
framework conditions for the CET. For example a different currency
other than GBP, different carbon values, higher or lower bonuses or
different analogies other than car miles to show the carbon footprint
of each decision.

Moreover, some modifications can be made in the Constants class of the
models.py file.
