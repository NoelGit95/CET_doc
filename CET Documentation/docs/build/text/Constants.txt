Constants
*********

The following Constants can be set in the Constants class:


Random Payoff
=============

   * "random_payoff" is used to define your preferred payoff
     calculation for the "player.payoff" field

   * If set to "True" a player’s payoff is only calculated in the
     "paying_round". The payoff in all other rounds is 0. See Paying
     Round

   * If set to "False" a player’s payoff is calculated in all rounds.


Random Saved Emission
=====================

   * "random_saved_emission" is used to define how the
     "Subsession.sum_saved_emission" field is calculated. See Sum
     saved Emission

   * If set to "True" the sum is calculated by adding each player’s
     saved emission in the "paying_round"

   * If set to "False" the saved emission for all rounds is added.


Bot Criteria
============

   * "Bot_criteria" is used to define the criteria as to when a player
     is seen as a bot.

   * "Bot_criteria" must be a value between 0-1 that represents the
     percentage of autonomous decisions a player has to make in order
     to be seen as human.

   * Example: The definition below means a player must decide
     autonomously (No Timeout happened) in at least 75% of all rounds.
     Otherwise the player is regarded as a bot.

   Bot_criteria = 0.75


Num Rounds
==========

   * This is an oTree specific variable that defines the number of
     rounds of the CET.

   * The number of rounds is defined as the length of the CET Data
     (csv file) that contains the carbon data.
