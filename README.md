# CET_doc
A Repo for the basic version of the Carbon Emission Task. 

## About the Carbon Emission Task
- The Carbon Emission Task (CET) is a new paradigm grounded in experimental economics to assess actual pro-environmental behavior.
- The CET can be used in laboratory, online, or classroom studies.
- Participants face repeated tradeoffs between financial bonus opportunities paired with real carbon emissions and foregoing such opportunities while staying carbon-neutral.
- The Paper "Measuring pro-environmental behavior using the Carbon Emission Task" (Berger & Wyss, 2021) was published in the *Journal of Environmental Psychology*
